## Usage

Just browse [./build/index.html](./build/index.html)

I'll find a way to make packages on github

I'll make an electron version when I have time

## Development

In order to develop (who would do that?), `svelte-material-ui` has a svelte5-ready version as `@next` (in branch `v8`), so it has to be cloned, branched and compiled locally (hence the `"devDependencies"` entry `"svelte-material-ui-dev": "file:../svelte-material-ui"`)
